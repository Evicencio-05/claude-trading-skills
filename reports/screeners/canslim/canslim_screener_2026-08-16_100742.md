## Methodology

This Phase 3 implementation includes all 7 CANSLIM components (100% coverage):

- **C** (Current Earnings) - 15% weight: Quarterly EPS growth YoY
- **A** (Annual Growth) - 20% weight: 3-year EPS CAGR
- **N** (Newness) - 15% weight: Price position vs 52-week high
- **S** (Supply/Demand) - 15% weight: Volume accumulation/distribution
- **L** (Leadership) - 20% weight: Multi-period weighted Relative Strength (3m/6m/12m) vs configurable benchmark
- **I** (Institutional) - 10% weight: Institutional holder analysis
- **M** (Market Direction) - 5% weight: S&P 500 trend

Component weights follow William O'Neil's original CANSLIM methodology,
with L (Leadership/RS Rank) as the most weighted component alongside A (Annual Growth).

**Weighted RS Calculation (Phase 3.1):**

```
Weighted RS = 0.40 × rel_3m + 0.30 × rel_6m + 0.30 × rel_12m
(When some periods are missing, the weights are re-normalized over available periods.)
Default benchmark: ^GSPC. Override with --rs-benchmark SPY/QQQ/IWM/...
```

Fallback hierarchy when full multi-period data is not available:

1. **No benchmark** → score from weighted absolute stock performance with a 20% penalty (legacy fallback).
2. **Multi-period unavailable but >=50 bars of price history** → fall back to the legacy 365-day full-window absolute return as the scoring input. The 20% penalty still applies when no benchmark is present.
3. **<50 bars of price history** → score=0 with `error` set; no scoring is performed.
